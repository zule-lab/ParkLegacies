This data and metadata accompanies Cooling effect provided by urban parks minimally affected by historical legacies, Richmond et al. (In prep).

dataset: studyparks.csv
This dataset lists all parks used in our study. 
ParkOfficial: Official name as listed in City of Montreal documents or on Open Street Map
Name: Unofficial park name occasionally used throughout documents
ObjectID: placeholder column (not meaningful)
Established: Year that the park was established (or closest year as per historical documents)
PastLandUse: Land use type immediately prior to park establishment

dataset: trees_openrefine.csv
This dataset lists all trees measured during the 2022 field season. Spelling and typos were addressed using OpenRefine.
Park: park name
PlotID: plot ID (ParkCode-CanopyCode)
Date: date of sampling
Observers: people working on sampling for that plot, initials
TreeNumber: nth tree for that plot 
CommonName: common name of tree (if tree is dead, Dead is used here. If tree is unknown, Unknown is used here)
Genus: scientific genus name of tree 
Species: scientific species name of tree (if not sure, sp. is written)
DBH: diameter at breast height (cm), if tree has a DBH < 5 cm, categories of 1-3 and 3-5 are used to classify instead of measuring
Overstory/Understory: categorical variable assigned to each tree, determining if they are an overstory or understory tree 
Comments: any comments made in the field for a specific tree

dataset: legacy-effects-trees.csv
Dataset containing plot-level variables collected in the field but not used for analysis.
Park: park name
PlotID: plot ID (ParkCode-CanopyCode)
Date: date of sampling
Observers: people working on sampling for that plot, initials
GroundCover: general ground cover of plot (grass, cement, shrubs, etc)
VegetationLevels: how many vegetation levels are present in the plot (herbaceous, shrub, understory, overstory)
PastLandUse: past land use immediately prior to development
Coordinates: plot location (crs WGS 84)
Temperature: temperature and weather on day of sampling
DensiometerN: number of canopy openings in the North direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
DensiometerS: number of canopy openings in the South direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
DensiometerE: number of canopy openings in the East direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
DensiometerW: number of canopy openings in the West direction using a densiometer (multiply by 1.04 for % canopy cover)
Comments: any comments on plot made in the field 
Park size: size of whole park (ha) 
Established: Year that the park was established (or closest year as per historical documents)
Park age: 2022 - year of establishment	
Conservation area: is this plot in a conservation area?
Complexity: number of levels of complexity (aka vegetation levels)
